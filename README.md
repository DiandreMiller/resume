## Concept:

Hereâ€™s the revised version with improved grammar:

The concept of this interactive resume is that I will be shooting a basketball. Every time a shot is made, a point on my resume will be revealed, along with a tally of successful shots versus missed ones. Each successful shot awards you a point, while a missed shot gives a point to the opponent. There will be a shot clock, and if it expires, the opponent will get a point. This continues until you reach the end of my resume, where a message saying "You win!" will appear, along with my contact information.

The page will load with an inspirational message.

## How will this be built?

I will likely use react framer motion to animate the character.
