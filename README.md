# Interactive Resume

## The Goal of this project is to build a resume that shows who I am as a developer.

The website will display:

- My personal background and talk a bit about me
- My goals/ dreams
- My techincal skills
- My soft skills
- My projects
- My education
- My professional experience
- Any certifications

## Framework: 

Tailwind CSS

## Potential Websites to get frame by frame image of a character

[Adobe Animate](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html) *7 Day trial
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3d animation
[Syfig Studio](https://www.synfig.org/)
[Spine](https://esotericsoftware.com/)
[Moho](https://moho.lostmarble.com/)
[Toon Boom Harmony](https://www.toonboom.com/products/harmony?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw3P-2BhAEEiwA3yPhwFg1qzrKm1TzTXsNoAnxlHiFYT3ihiYUwzPSaAWMIJZvsA8JsBCFihoC5_UQAvD_BwE)
[Vyond](https://www.vyond.com/)
[Pivot Animator](https://pivotanimator.net/)
[Maxamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/)
[Animaker](https://www.animaker.com/)
[Adobe Character Animator](https://www.adobe.com/products/character-animator.html)
[Pencil 2D](https://www.pencil2d.org/)

[Daz Studio](https://www.daz3d.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopgoMwLs3csxqH0jCsURmBxQwbcnta5-C5VLbyoo0YUZ0o4dO0A)
[Clara.io](https://clara.io/)
[Sculptris](https://www.sculpteo.com/en/glossary/sculptris-definition/)
//Spline.design is also an option.


Make human does not seem to be an option. It does not seem like it is working.

### It looks like I will go with Daz Studio to create the character


* Chat GPT Recommendations 

If you want full creative control over your custom character and their movements, Spine, Adobe Animate, or Blender are excellent options, especially if you want to add fine details like the motion of arms, legs, and the basketball itself.
For simpler and faster animation, Vyond or Moho are good for basic animations and quick projects.

For Quick and Simple 2D Animation: Try Animaker or Pivot Animator if you want something beginner-friendly and web-based.
For Professional 2D Animation: Adobe Animate or Toon Boom Harmony would give you more control and detail over your animations.
For 3D Animation: Mixamo is a great option for easily animating a 3D character with predefined motions like shooting a basketball, while Blender offers more control if you want to create everything from scratch.

* Chat GPT recommendations for free 2d animations:

For a completely free 2D animation experience, I recommend starting with Synfig Studio or OpenToonz if you want something with more features. Pencil2D is best if you prefer simple frame-by-frame animations. Blender (Grease Pencil) is ideal if you want to combine 2D with powerful animation tools.

* Chat GPT recommendations for free 3d animations:

Blender is the best all-around choice for free 3D animation. It has a robust set of tools for creating, rigging, and animating characters, and can simulate realistic movements (like shooting a basketball).
If you want to quickly create a human character and animate it, try using MakeHuman for character creation and Blender for the animation.
For pre-rigged characters and quick animations, Mixamo is a great option, especially if youâ€™re focused on animating the action rather than building everything from scratch.

## Concept:

The concept of this interactive resume is that I will be shooting a basketball. Every time a shot is made, a point on my resume will be revealed, along with a tally of successful shots versus missed ones. Each successful shot awards you a point, while a missed shot gives a point to the opponent. There will be a shot clock, and if it expires, the opponent will get a point. This continues until you reach the end of my resume, where a message saying "You win!" will appear, along with my contact information. On the contact me page, I will have a link that the user can click which can help build a resume just by a person describing what they do or by answering questions.

* Idea: Do not create a character right away, just have user shoot a basketball into the net, the character can be developed and added later. 

The page will load with an inspirational message.

* Figure out how to make the basketball bounce

## How will this be built?

I will likely use react framer motion to animate the character.

## Other Considerations:

Material UI

## Get Started

In your terminal, type:
- npm install
- npm run dev

Possibly consider 2d animations

Maybe consider finding characters online.
