# Interactive Resume

## The Goal of this project is to build a resume that shows who I am as a developer.

The website will display:

- My personal background and talk a bit about me
- My goals/ dreams
- My techincal skills
- My soft skills
- My projects
- My education
- My professional experience
- Any certifications

## Framework: 

Tailwind CSS

## Concept:

The concept of this interactive resume will be to have me shoot a basketball, everytime the player makes a shot, a point on my resume will be revealed and it will show how many shots they made vs missed. This will happen until they get to the end of my resume where it will say "You win!" along with my contact info. 

## How will this be built?

I will likely use react framer motion to animate the character.
